# Fork of QickJS project

Authors: Fabrice Bellard, Charlie Gordon, Andrew Fedoniouk (a.k.a. c-smile)

Forked from [bellard](https://bellard.org/quickjs/), well its official GitHub [mirror](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs), with the MS Windows patches from another fork, [c-smile](https://github.com/c-smile/quickjspp). A big thank you for the work they have done.

Forked By Geoff R. McLane

This FORKED version is built using the [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) build file generator.

The original main documentation is in doc/quickjs.pdf or [doc/quickjs.html](doc/quickjs.html), generated by `c-smile`.


## Build

CMake will support several build systems in your OS. Used `cmake --help` to view. It usually has a default - MSVC in Windows, Makefile in Unix. Otherwise a `Generator` can be set on the command line, or in the CMake GUI.

### Windows

**Prerequisites**: [DIRENT](https://github.com/geoffmcl/dirent), and [GETOPTS](https://github.com/geoffmcl/wingetopt), libraries and header already built and installed.

If you have MSVC installed, then cmake will default to build solution files, for it - then the following steps apply -

     1> Clone this source, in to a projects folder `git clone https://github.com/geoffmcl/quickjs.git qjs-fork`
     2> cd qjs-fork\build # get into an out-of-source build folder
     3> cmake -S .. [options] # this assumes DIRENT and GETOPTS libraries can be found
     4> cmake --build . --config Release # build the project, using MSVC `msbuild` app.
     5> cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL # if you have set a suitable -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<d:\install>

Or, if MSVC, the MSVC IDE can be used to load the generated solution file, .
    
### Linux

Usually the `dirent`, and `getopt` will already be installed.

     1> Clone this source, in to a projects folder `git clone https://github.com/geoffmcl/quickjs.git qjs-fork`
     2> cd qjs-fork/build # get into an out-of-source build folder
     3> cmake -S .. [options] # this assumes DIRENT and GETOPTS libraries can be found
     4> make # build the project..
     5> make install # if desired
